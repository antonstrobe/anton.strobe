# Object Counter

This repository contains a simple Python program that uses [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) to detect and count objects from a webcam. Detected objects are highlighted with bounding boxes and the total number of items is displayed on the screen.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or newer
- Windows with a webcam

## Usage

Run `run.bat` to upgrade `pip`, install the dependencies and start the program. Close the window or press `q` to stop the capture.
